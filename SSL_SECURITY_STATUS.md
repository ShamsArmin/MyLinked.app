# SSL Security Status - Normal During DNS Propagation

## Current "Website Not Secure" Error

### What's Happening
- **Browser Error**: "Website is not secure" 
- **Technical Reason**: SSL certificate doesn't recognize www.mylinked.app yet
- **Status**: Normal during DNS propagation period

### Why This Happens
1. **SSL Certificate**: Currently issued for personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367.replit.app
2. **Custom Domain**: www.mylinked.app not yet recognized by certificate
3. **DNS Propagation**: Still in progress (24-48 hours)

### Expected Timeline
- **Immediate**: DNS connection working (âœ… achieved)
- **6-24 hours**: SSL certificate updates automatically
- **24-48 hours**: Full security and functionality

## Tell GoDaddy Support

**"The 'website not secure' error is expected during DNS propagation. The SSL certificate needs time to recognize the new domain. The DNS records are working correctly - we can see the domain connecting to the right server. This SSL issue will resolve automatically within 24-48 hours as part of normal DNS propagation."**

## Technical Details

### Current Status

SSL: Certificate updating (automatic process)
```
