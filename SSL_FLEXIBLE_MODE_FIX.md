# SSL Flexible Mode Fix - Final Solution

## Current Status
- Orange proxy enabled ✅
- SSL certificate error persists ❌
- Need to change SSL mode to "Flexible"

## Solution: Change SSL Mode to Flexible

### Step 1: Change SSL/TLS Mode
1. Go to Cloudflare dashboard → SSL/TLS → Overview
2. Change encryption mode from "Full" to **"Flexible"**
3. Click "Configure" button if needed
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for changes to apply

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache
1. Clear your browser cache/cookies
2. Or try in incognito/private browsing mode
3. This ensures you get the new SSL configuration

### Step 3: Test Domain
- Try: https://www.mylinked.app
- Should work without SSL warnings
- Should show your MyLinked application

## Why Flexible Mode Works
- **Flexible**: Cloudflare ↔ Visitor (HTTPS), Cloudflare ↔ Origin (HTTP)
- **Full**: Cloudflare ↔ Visitor (HTTPS), Cloudflare ↔ Origin (HTTPS)
- Since your Replit app doesn't have a valid SSL certificate for mylinked.app, Flexible mode allows Cloudflare to handle SSL termination

## Alternative Access Methods
If SSL issues persist:

### Method 1: Use HTTP (Temporary)
- Try: http://www.mylinked.app
- This bypasses SSL entirely

### Method 2: Use Direct Replit URL
- Use: https://personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367.replit.app
- This works with Replit's SSL certificate

### Method 3: Different Browser
- Try Chrome, Firefox, or Safari
- Sometimes different browsers handle SSL differently

## Expected Result
After changing to Flexible mode:
- https://www.mylinked.app → Your MyLinked app (no SSL warning)
- http://www.mylinked.app → Redirects to https version
- Valid SSL certificate from Cloudflare

Your domain connection is working perfectly - just need the correct SSL mode configuration.
