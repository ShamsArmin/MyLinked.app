# Domain Status Check - www.mylinked.app

## Current Status (After Adding DNS Records)

### DNS Status: ✅ WORKING
- A record is resolving correctly
- TXT record is in place
- DNS propagation is working

### SSL Status: ⏳ PENDING
- SSL certificate not yet provisioned
- This is normal - SSL takes additional time after DNS

### Expected Timeline
- DNS: Working now ✅
- SSL: Up to 24-48 hours ⏳

## Next Steps

### 1. Check Replit Dashboard
- Go to your deployment settings
- Check if domain shows "Verified" status
- SSL certificate will be provisioned automatically

### 2. Wait for SSL Certificate
- Replit automatically provisions SSL certificates
- This happens after domain verification
- Can take 1-24 hours after DNS propagation

### 3. Test Domain
- HTTP: http://www.mylinked.app (should work now)
- HTTPS: https://www.mylinked.app (will work after SSL)

## Current Error Analysis

The SSL error "no alternative certificate subject name matches target hostname" means:
- ✅ DNS is working correctly
- ✅ Your A record is pointing to the right server
- ⏳ SSL certificate is being generated

## What to Monitor

1. **Replit Dashboard**: Check for "Verified" status
2. **SSL Certificate**: Test HTTPS periodically
3. **Full Functionality**: Test login, profiles, etc. once HTTPS works

## Troubleshooting (If Needed)

If domain doesn't work after 48 hours:
1. Check Replit dashboard for verification status
2. Screenshot DNS records in GoDaddy
3. Contact Replit support with new deployment details

## Current Progress: 80% Complete

✅ DNS Records Added
✅ DNS Propagation Working
✅ Domain Resolving
⏳ SSL Certificate Pending
⏳ Full HTTPS Access Pending

Your domain setup is working correctly! Just waiting for SSL certificate provisioning.
