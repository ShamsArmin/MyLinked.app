# Twitter OAuth Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status
- OAuth 2.0 credentials are correct
- Multiple OAuth flow approaches tested - all show "Something went wrong"
- This indicates a Twitter app configuration issue

## Exact Redirect URI Required
Your Twitter app must have this **exact** callback URL configured:

```
https://db7e7862-12d2-42a3-94ed-8dde37129e5e-00-1t9k44b80d2ae.spock.replit.dev/api/twitter/callback
```

## Steps to Fix in Twitter Developer Portal

1. **Go to your Twitter Developer Portal**
2. **Select your app**
3. **Click "App Settings" or "Edit App"**
4. **Find "Authentication settings" or "App permissions"**
5. **Look for "Callback URLs" or "Redirect URIs"**
6. **Add or update to exactly match:**
   ```

   ```

## Common Issues That Cause "Something went wrong"

1. **Missing Callback URL**: No redirect URI configured
2. **Incorrect Callback URL**: Even small differences (http vs https, trailing slash, etc.)
3. **App Type Restrictions**: Some app types have additional requirements
4. **App Review Status**: Some features require Twitter's approval

## Verification Steps

After updating the callback URL in Twitter:
1. Save the changes
2. Wait a few minutes for propagation
3. Try the Twitter connection again

## If Still Not Working

Check these in your Twitter app:
- **App Type**: Try changing between "Web App" and "Native App"
- **App Permissions**: Ensure "Read" permissions are enabled
- **App Status**: Check if app is active/approved

The redirect URI mismatch is the most common cause of this specific error.
