# Facebook Business Verification - Final Step

## Current Status
Your Facebook app (2696553390542098) is **99% complete**:
- ✅ All required fields filled
- ✅ App Mode set to "Live"
- ✅ App Icon uploaded
- ✅ URLs configured
- ❌ **Business Verification** - Final step needed

## Why Business Verification is Required
Facebook requires business verification for Live Mode apps to:
- Prevent spam and fake apps
- Ensure legitimate business operations
- Enable full OAuth functionality without restrictions

## Business Verification Process

### Option 1: Quick Business Verification (Recommended)
1. **Click "Start verification"** in your Facebook Developer Console
2. **Business Information**:
   - Business Name: MyLinked
   - Business Type: Technology/Software
   - Website: https://www.mylinked.app
   - Business Email: info@mylinked.app
3. **Verification Method**: Choose easiest option:
   - **Phone verification** (fastest)
   - **Email verification** (if phone not available)
   - **Business documents** (if others fail)

### Option 2: Alternative - Add Test Users (Immediate)
If verification takes too long:
1. Go to **Roles → Test Users**
2. Click **"Add Test Users"**
3. **Add your Facebook account** as a test user
4. OAuth will work immediately for test users

## Expected Timeline
- **Phone/Email Verification**: 5-15 minutes
- **Document Verification**: 1-3 business days
- **Test User Method**: Immediate (works right away)

## After Verification
Once business verification is complete:
- "Feature Unavailable" error will disappear
- All users can login with Facebook
- No more restrictions

## Quick Decision
**For immediate testing**: Use Test Users method
**For full production**: Complete Business Verification
