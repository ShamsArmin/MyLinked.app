# Fresh Deployment Guide - Clean Start

## Why This Is a Good Idea

Starting fresh will:
- Remove any conflicting configurations from the old deployment
- Get clean deployment-specific DNS records
- Avoid legacy issues with the domain setup
- Start with proper SSL configuration from day 1

## Step 1: Delete Current Deployment

1. Go to https://replit.com/deployments
2. Find your deployment: `personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367`
3. Click **Settings** → **Delete Deployment**
4. Confirm deletion

## Step 2: Prepare for New Deployment

Before creating new deployment:

### A. Ensure Your Project is Ready
- Code is working properly
- All dependencies are installed
- Build process works correctly

### B. Plan Your Domain Strategy
Choose ONE approach:
- **Option 1**: Use `www.mylinked.app` (requires A + TXT records)
- **Option 2**: Use `app.mylinked.app` (can use CNAME - easier)

## Step 3: Create New Deployment

1. In your Replit project, click **Deploy**
2. Choose **Autoscale Deployment** (recommended for web apps)
3. Configure deployment settings:
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Run Command**: `npm start`
   - **Root Directory**: `/`

## Step 4: Configure Custom Domain IMMEDIATELY

**Don't wait for deployment to finish completely**

1. Go to **Deployments** → **Settings**
2. Click **Link a domain**
3. Enter your domain: `www.mylinked.app` or `app.mylinked.app`
4. Replit will generate specific DNS records

## Step 5: Update DNS at GoDaddy

### For www.mylinked.app:
- Remove old CNAME record
- Add A record (IP from Replit)
- Add TXT record (verification from Replit)

### For app.mylinked.app:
- Add CNAME record: `app.mylinked.app` → `[new-deployment-name].replit.app`

## Step 6: Monitor and Verify

1. Wait for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)
2. Check Replit dashboard for "Verified" status
3. Test domain: `https://www.mylinked.app` or `https://app.mylinked.app`

## Benefits of Fresh Start

- Clean deployment URL
- No legacy configuration issues
- Proper SSL setup from beginning
- Deployment-specific DNS records
- Fresh troubleshooting with support if needed

## What to Do If Issues Persist

If domain still doesn't work after fresh deployment:
1. Screenshot of new deployment settings
2. Screenshot of DNS records
3. Contact Replit support with NEW deployment details

## Alternative: Use app.mylinked.app

Consider using `app.mylinked.app` instead of `www.mylinked.app`:
- Uses CNAME (simpler)
- No A record complications
- Faster setup
- More reliable
