# SSL Certificate Fix - Enable Cloudflare Proxy

## Current Issue
- Domain connects to your app ✅
- SSL certificate error persists ❌
- Root cause: Using origin server SSL certificate instead of Cloudflare's

## Solution: Enable Cloudflare Proxy

### Step 1: Enable Proxy for www Record
1. Go to Cloudflare dashboard → DNS
2. Find your www CNAME record
3. Click the gray cloud icon to turn it orange (Proxied)
4. This enables Cloudflare's SSL certificate

### Step 2: Change SSL Mode to Flexible
1. Go to SSL/TLS → Overview
2. Change encryption mode from "Full" to "Flexible"
3. This allows Cloudflare to handle SSL termination

### Step 3: Test Domain
- Wait 2-3 minutes for changes to propagate
- Test: https://www.mylinked.app
- Should work without SSL warnings

## Why This Works
- Cloudflare proxy provides valid SSL certificate for mylinked.app
- "Flexible" mode allows HTTP connection to origin server
- Visitors get HTTPS, origin server uses HTTP

## DNS Records Should Be:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Content: personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367.replit.app
Proxy: Proxied (orange cloud) ← Change this
```

## Alternative: Bypass SSL Warning Temporarily
To access your site immediately:
1. Click "Advanced" in SSL warning
2. Click "visit this website"
3. This bypasses the warning to access your app

Your domain connection is working perfectly - just need to enable Cloudflare's SSL proxy to resolve the certificate issue.
