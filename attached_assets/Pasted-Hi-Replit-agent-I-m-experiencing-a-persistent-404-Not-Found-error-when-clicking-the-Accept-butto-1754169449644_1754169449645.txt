Hi Replit agent,

I'm experiencing a persistent 404 Not Found error when clicking the ‚ÄúAccept‚Äù button on the collaborative-page.tsx. Here's a full breakdown of what is happening and what I need help with:

‚ùó Issue Summary:
I send a collaboration request from a public profile.

I get a notification in my dashboard, and when I click "View", it takes me to /collaborative-page correctly.

On the collaborative page, I see the request and click ‚ÄúAccept‚Äù.

However, this triggers a PATCH request to /api/collaboration-requests/:id/status, which returns a 404 Not Found error.

‚úÖ What Has Been Verified / Done So Far:
Frontend is correctly calling this API route:

ts
Copy
Edit
await fetch(`/api/collaboration-requests/${id}/status`, {
  method: "PATCH",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ status }),
});
I‚Äôve implemented this backend route in routes.ts:

ts
Copy
Edit
app.patch("/api/collaboration-requests/:id/status", async (req, res) => {
  const id = Number(req.params.id);
  const { status } = req.body;
  console.log("Incoming request: PATCH /api/collaboration-requests/" + id + "/status");
  const request = await storage.getCollaborationRequestById(id);
  if (!request) {
    console.log("Collaboration request", id, "not found");
    return res.status(404).json({ message: "Collaboration request not found" });
  }
  const updated = await storage.updateCollaborationRequest(id, { status });
  res.json(updated);
});
I confirmed that the frontend and backend paths match.

I added the updateCollaborationRequest() method to db-storage-enhanced.ts (this works fine).

I added getCollaborationRequestById(id) as well ‚Äî and it's returning undefined, which causes the 404.

In the console, I see:

bash
Copy
Edit
Incoming request: PATCH /api/collaboration-requests/41/status
Updating collaboration request 41 status to accepted
Collaboration request 41 not found
üîç Suspected Issue:
The backend cannot find the record in the database.

I believe either:

The data is not being saved in the correct table (collaborationRequestsNotifications)

The request is created but not saved properly

The ID in the database is not matching due to a mismatch or filtering problem

‚úÖ What I Need from You:
Please do the following:

Debug the storage function getCollaborationRequestById(id):

Add a console.log() to print all current collaboration requests.

Confirm whether ID 41 (or the latest ID I'm trying to accept) actually exists in the table.

Check if createCollaborationRequest() is saving to the correct table (collaborationRequestsNotifications).

If the ID is missing, fix whatever causes the insert to silently fail or not return the created object with ID.

Make sure that the created collaboration request is properly accessible through its ID so that updateCollaborationRequest() works and doesn‚Äôt 404.

Thank you!

Let me know what is missing and what was found in the database.
