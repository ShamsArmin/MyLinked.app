I'm encountering an issue with the Collaboration Request feature in my application.

When a visitor submits a collaboration request using the form, I successfully receive a notification in my dashboard. However, there are two critical problems after that:

Broken View Link in Notification:
When I click the View icon in the notification, a new page opens but shows the error:
👉 "Page not found"
This likely means the link or route handler for the collaboration request view page is broken, incorrectly configured, or missing entirely. Please verify:

That the route being linked from the notification is correct (e.g., /collaborations/:id or a similar route).

That the frontend has a corresponding page and React route to display a single collaboration request by ID.

That the server’s route (GET /api/collaborations/:id) is working and returning valid data for the request.

Request Not Visible on Collaboration Page (Requests Tab):
After receiving the notification, I expect the request to appear on the Requests tab of the Collaboration page in my dashboard — but nothing shows up. Please check:

That the GET /api/collaborations (or equivalent) API returns all collaboration requests submitted to the logged-in user.

That the collaboration request is stored correctly in the database and associated with the intended recipient user.

That the frontend renders requests correctly in the Requests tab, and properly filters for the user’s role (creator or receiver).

That status labels like "pending", "approved", or "rejected" are used consistently and not causing a filtering mismatch.

Also, make sure that:

Collaboration requests use consistent status values (if applicable), and are not filtered out due to naming mismatches like “pending” vs “waiting” etc.

The system supports displaying detailed information from the collaboration form — such as name, email, message, topic of collaboration, etc. — inside the dashboard interface.

✅ Summary of what needs fixing:

 Clicking "View" on a collaboration request notification should open a valid page with full details.

 Collaboration requests should show up on the Collaboration Page > Requests tab in the user's dashboard.

 API and routing should be verified and debugged both on the frontend and backend to ensure full consistency and visibility of collaboration requests.

Please investigate and help resolve this issue — it’s critical for collaboration functionality and currently blocking user interaction.
