The previous solution didn‚Äôt solve the real problem. Please read this carefully ‚Äî this is not a state update issue.

üß† ACTUAL ISSUE DESCRIPTION:
I created and sent a real collaboration request from the public profile page.

Then I go to the dashboard and click on the View icon, which sends me to the CollaborativePage (Collaborative Requests tab).

I see the notification count, but the request is invisible on the page.

But when I use a test user or manually inject a request, it works as expected ‚Äî the request appears correctly in the list and moves to the Accepted/Rejected tab after interaction.

üîç WHAT THIS LIKELY MEANS:
This is not a UI problem ‚Äî it‚Äôs probably one of the following:

üîß THINGS TO INVESTIGATE IN DETAIL:
1. ‚úÖ Check if the logged-in user (req.user.id) is being used correctly:
In the /api/collaboration-requests/received route (used by CollaborativePage), verify that it returns requests where receiverId === logged-in user id.

If req.user.id is undefined, wrong, or refers to the sender instead of the receiver, then the returned list will be empty.

In the real flow (via public profile), it may be sending requests to the wrong receiverId, or the receiverId is not matched correctly in the backend logic.

2. ‚úÖ Check how the request is created (on public profile page):
When submitting the collaboration request from the public profile page, double-check that:

The receiverId is correctly set (i.e., the user whose profile is being viewed).

The senderId is the currently logged-in user.

A mismatch here would cause the /received endpoint to return nothing, even though the request exists in the DB.

3. ‚úÖ Log and Inspect Returned Data:
In collaborative-page.tsx, log the full response from /api/collaboration-requests/received:

tsx
Copy
Edit
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchRequests = async () => {
    try {
      const res = await fetch("/api/collaboration-requests/received");
      const data = await res.json();
      console.log("Fetched requests:", data);  // ‚Üê add this
      setRequests(data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Failed to fetch requests:", error);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };
  fetchRequests();
}, []);
Then:

Confirm that data contains the expected collaboration request when you come via the real flow (not test user).

If data is empty ‚Äî then it‚Äôs a backend filtering or session auth issue.

4. ‚úÖ Verify That Authentication Middleware Works Properly:
Check that the route /api/collaboration-requests/received has isAuthenticated middleware applied and that req.user.id is correctly available.

It could be that when redirected from public profile ‚Üí dashboard ‚Üí collaborative page, the session is not persisted correctly.

‚úÖ STEPS YOU SHOULD TAKE:
Add debug logging in /api/collaboration-requests/received route:

ts
Copy
Edit
console.log("Authenticated user ID:", req.user?.id);
const requests = await getReceivedRequests(req.user.id);
console.log("Returned requests:", requests);
In the frontend collaborative-page.tsx, also log the fetched request data.

In the public profile submission logic, verify:

That you're correctly sending receiverId (target profile‚Äôs user ID).

That the sender is the logged-in user.

Fix any mismatches in how collaboration requests are created or filtered. The receiver must be the dashboard‚Äôs logged-in user.
