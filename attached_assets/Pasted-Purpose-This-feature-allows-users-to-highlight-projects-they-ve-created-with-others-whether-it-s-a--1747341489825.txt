Purpose:
This feature allows users to highlight projects they’ve created with others—whether it’s a video, portfolio, catalog, event, campaign, or any other creative or professional collaboration. It brings recognition, transparency, and a strong community feel to each profile.

How It Works:
	1.	Add a Project Link
The user can add a project by entering a title and pasting a URL (YouTube, Behance, Google Drive, external website, etc.)
	2.	Tag Team Members or Contributors
The user can mention other users of the app who were involved in the project—such as:
	•	Co-creators
	•	Team members
	•	Sponsors
	•	Companies/agencies involved
(Mentions appear as clickable profiles under the project link.)
	3.	Add Logo or Image Thumbnail
Each project can have a small visual beside it—either:
	•	A logo of the brand or team
	•	A cover image from the project (auto-fetched or uploaded manually)
	4.	Short Description or Tagline
A short text field for explaining the project in 1–2 sentences. Example:
“A 3D-printed furniture catalog created in collaboration with Studio Forma and EcoPrint.”
	5.	Optional Icons / Labels:
Let users add up to 3 visual tags per project link, such as:
	•	“Award-Winning”
	•	“In Progress”
	•	“Sustainability”
	•	“UX/UI”
	•	“Architecture”
	•	“Team of 5”
These tags help visitors quickly understand the context of the project.
	6.	Social Proof:
Show a mini-counter of profile visits or clicks on that project (e.g. “Viewed 124 times”) to encourage more interaction.
	7.	Pin to Top of Profile (Optional)
Allow users to feature 1–2 projects at the top of their profile for extra visibility.

Simple UX/UI Add-ons:
	•	Smooth carousel display for multiple project links
	•	Animated hover/click effects for logo and team tags
	•	Lightbox popup to preview a YouTube/Vimeo video without leaving the app
	•	Mini badge showing the user’s role: Designer, Developer, Editor, etc.

Why It’s Great:
	•	Gives users a way to show real collaborations, not just static links.
	•	Encourages networking, as users explore each other’s team projects.
	•	Adds a layer of professional credibility and social proof to each profile
