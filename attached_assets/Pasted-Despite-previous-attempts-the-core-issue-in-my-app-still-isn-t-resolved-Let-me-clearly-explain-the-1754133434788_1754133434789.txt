Despite previous attempts, the core issue in my app still isn’t resolved. Let me clearly explain the behavior and what needs to be fixed.

❗️PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
On the collaboration dashboard, I can see incoming requests under the "Pending Requests" tab.

When I click Accept or Reject, the request disappears from the UI but doesn’t show up under "Accepted" or "Rejected" tabs.

Nothing appears in any tab after status update. Only a full page refresh shows the updated state correctly.

✅ WHAT I EXPECT TO HAPPEN:
After clicking Accept or Reject:

The request's status should be updated in the backend (which seems to work).

The frontend should move the request from the “Pending” tab to either “Accepted” or “Rejected” without refreshing.

📌 WHAT IS ALREADY IMPLEMENTED:
Backend PATCH /api/collaboration-requests/:id endpoint is implemented and working correctly.

updateCollaborationRequestStatus and getCollaborationRequestById exist and work.

The frontend calls the updateStatus function via fetch when user clicks Accept or Reject.

Data is stored using Prisma in a collaborationRequest model with a status field.

🧠 POSSIBLE CAUSES (You Should Investigate):
The frontend isn’t re-rendering properly after state update.

The setRequests(...) call inside the updateStatus method might not update the state correctly.

Check how updatedRequest is structured and whether it's consistent with the original array objects.

updateStatus response shape is incorrect.

The API response might return { success: true, request: {...} }, but the code may expect only the object itself.

Ensure the updatedRequest assignment is correctly updating the status field of that item in setRequests.

No refetch is triggered.

You might need to refetch all requests or at least force a state update so React re-renders the filtered sections correctly.

Frontend filtering issue in renderSection().

Check if the status field is not being updated correctly after calling .map(...).

Add logging or console inspection to see what the state holds after the mutation.

✅ STEPS TO FIX:
✅ Ensure your backend returns the updated request object only, like this:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "id": 12,
  "senderName": "John",
  "status": "accepted",
  "message": "Let's collaborate!"
}
— not wrapped in { success: true, request: {...} }, unless frontend unwraps it.

✅ In frontend, update this logic in updateStatus():

tsx
Copy
Edit
const updated = await res.json();
setRequests((prev) =>
  prev.map((r) => (r.id === id ? updated : r))
);
If the response is { request: {...} }, you must change to:

tsx
Copy
Edit
const updated = (await res.json()).request;
✅ Alternatively, fetch all updated collaboration requests again after status change:

tsx
Copy
Edit
await fetchRequests();
and refactor fetchRequests into a shared function inside the component.

✅ Confirm filtering logic in renderSection() works with updated status:

tsx
Copy
Edit
const filtered = requests.filter((r) => r.status === filter);
✅ Add console.log(requests) after setRequests to verify state is correctly updated and that the status changes are visible to the filtered tabs.

🔁 OPTIONAL: Use SWR or React Query instead of manual state updates if this becomes too messy.
Please go step by step and test if the request appears in the correct tab after accepting or rejecting it — without needing a page reload.

Let me know if you need me to provide any additional context.
