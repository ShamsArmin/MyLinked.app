# IMMEDIATE DOMAIN FIX - Cloudflare Solution

## STOP the DNS Change Loop

You've been changing DNS records back and forth for 2 weeks. This ends NOW.

## Immediate Solution: Cloudflare Proxy

This will work in 1-2 hours, not 48 hours.

### Step 1: Create Cloudflare Account
1. Go to https://cloudflare.com/
2. Sign up for free account
3. Add domain: mylinked.app

### Step 2: Cloudflare Will Scan Your DNS
- It will find your existing records
- Keep the CNAME: www → personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367.replit.app
- Don't change anything else

### Step 3: Change Nameservers at GoDaddy
Cloudflare will give you 2 nameservers like:
- ns1.cloudflare.com
- ns2.cloudflare.com

Replace GoDaddy nameservers with Cloudflare nameservers.

### Step 4: Enable SSL in Cloudflare
1. Go to SSL/TLS → Overview
2. Set to "Full" or "Full (strict)"
3. Enable "Always Use HTTPS"

### Step 5: Enable Proxy
Make sure the orange cloud is ON for www record.

## Why This Works Immediately

- No need to change DNS records
- No 48-hour wait times

2. Deploy to Netlify or Vercel
3. Add custom domain there
4. SSL works automatically

## Stop Wasting Time
