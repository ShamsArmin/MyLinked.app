# Cloudflare SSL Certificate Fix

## Current Issue
- Domain connects successfully ✅
- DNS records working ✅  
- SSL certificate error ❌ ("This Connection Is Not Private")

## Root Cause
The SSL certificate is for a different domain (likely Replit's certificate), not for mylinked.app.

## Solution: Configure Cloudflare SSL

### Step 1: Enable SSL/TLS in Cloudflare
1. Go to your Cloudflare dashboard
2. Click on "mylinked.app" 
3. Go to "SSL/TLS" tab in sidebar
4. Set SSL/TLS encryption mode to: **"Full"** or **"Flexible"**

### Step 2: Enable Always Use HTTPS
1. In SSL/TLS settings
2. Go to "Edge Certificates"
3. Turn ON "Always Use HTTPS"
4. Turn ON "Automatic HTTPS Rewrites"

### Step 3: Alternative Fix - Change Proxy Status
If SSL issues persist:
1. Go to DNS tab
2. Click on the orange cloud next to www record
3. Change from "DNS only" to "Proxied" (orange cloud)
4. This enables Cloudflare's SSL certificate

### Step 4: Wait for Certificate Provisioning
- Cloudflare automatically provisions SSL certificates
- This takes 15-30 minutes
- Certificate will be valid for mylinked.app

## Expected Result
After configuration:
- https://www.mylinked.app works without SSL warnings
- Automatic redirect from http to https
- Valid SSL certificate for your domain

## Alternative Quick Fix
If you need immediate access, you can:
1. Click "Advanced" in the SSL warning
2. Click "visit this website" to bypass temporarily
3. But proper SSL configuration is recommended

The domain routing is working perfectly - just need to configure SSL properly in Cloudflare.
