# Complete Fix for Redirect Loop Issue

## Root Cause Analysis
The domain www.mylinked.app is stuck in an infinite redirect loop:
- Request: https://www.mylinked.app
- Redirects to: https://www.mylinked.app:443/  
- Redirects to: https://www.mylinked.app:443/
- **Infinite loop continues...**

## Primary Solution: Fix SSL/TLS Mode

### Step 1: Change SSL/TLS Mode in Cloudflare
1. **Go to Cloudflare Dashboard**
2. **Click on your domain: mylinked.app**
3. **Go to SSL/TLS section**
4. **Change from "Flexible" to "Full"**
   - Current: Flexible (causes redirect loops)
   - Change to: Full (proper SSL handling)

### Step 2: Verify DNS Settings
Ensure your DNS records are:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www  
Target: personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367.replit.app
Proxy: Orange cloud (Proxied)
```

### Step 3: Clear Cache
1. **Go to Caching â†’ Purge Cache**
2. **Select "Purge Everything"**
3. **Wait 5-10 minutes**

## Alternative Solution: DNS Only Mode

If SSL Full mode doesn't work:

### Step 1: Disable Cloudflare Proxy
1. **Go to DNS records**
2. **Click on the orange cloud next to www record**
3. **Change to gray cloud (DNS only)**
4. **Save**

### Step 2: Wait for propagation (15-30 minutes)

## Technical Explanation

**Why the redirect loop happens:**
- Cloudflare "Flexible" SSL mode accepts HTTPS requests
- But forwards HTTP to the origin server  
- Replit expects HTTPS connections
- Creates infinite redirect between HTTP/HTTPS

**Why "Full" SSL mode fixes it:**
- Maintains HTTPS throughout the entire connection
- No HTTP/HTTPS conversion conflicts
- Proper SSL termination

## Verification Steps

After making changes, test:
```bash
curl -I https://www.mylinked.app
```

Should return:
```
HTTP/2 200 OK
```

NOT:
```
HTTP/2 301 
location: https://www.mylinked.app:443/
```

## Emergency Alternative

If domain still doesn't work after SSL changes:
1. **Use the direct Replit URL temporarily:**
   - https://personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367.replit.app
2. **This confirms the application works perfectly**
3. **Issue is purely DNS/SSL configuration**

## Timeline
- **SSL mode change**: Takes effect immediately
- **DNS propagation**: 15-30 minutes maximum
- **Full resolution**: Within 1 hour

The redirect loop will be completely resolved once SSL mode is changed from Flexible to Full.
