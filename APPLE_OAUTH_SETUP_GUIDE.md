# Apple OAuth Implementation Guide

## Quick Apple Sign-In Setup

If Facebook Live Mode requires business verification that you can't complete, I can implement Apple OAuth as an excellent alternative.

### Apple OAuth Benefits
- **Privacy-focused**: Apple's commitment to user privacy
- **Cross-platform**: Works on iOS, macOS, and web
- **No business verification**: Simpler setup process
- **Professional appearance**: Clean, modern Apple branding
- **Fast implementation**: 15-20 minutes to complete

### Apple Developer Setup Required
1. **Apple Developer Account** (free or paid)
2. **App ID registration** for MyLinked
3. **Services ID configuration** for web authentication
4. **Key generation** for server-side verification

### Technical Implementation
- OAuth 2.0 flow with Apple's authorization server
- JWT token verification for secure authentication
- User profile data (name, email) with privacy controls
- Seamless integration with existing auth system

### Setup Steps (if you choose this option)
1. Create Apple Developer account (if needed)
2. Register MyLinked as an App ID
3. Configure Services ID for web domain
4. Generate private key for server authentication
5. Provide Apple credentials for integration

## Alternative: Facebook Development Mode
If you prefer to keep Facebook OAuth, switch your app to Development Mode:
1. Facebook Developer Console → App Settings → Basic
2. Switch "App Mode" from Live to Development
3. Add your Facebook account as a developer
4. Facebook OAuth works immediately for you
