# Domain Connection Fix - Step by Step Instructions

## Current DNS Problem Analysis
- **mylinked.app**: Points to 15.197.142.173 (wrong IP, causing timeout)
- **www.mylinked.app**: Points to 34.117.33.233 (SSL certificate mismatch)
- **Result**: Both domains are inaccessible

## Required DNS Changes

### Delete These Records:
1. **A Record**: mylinked.app â†’ 15.197.142.173 (DELETE THIS)
2. Any other A records pointing to wrong IPs

### Add These Records:
1. **CNAME Record**: 
   - Name: @ (root domain)
   - Value: personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367.replit.app
   - TTL: 300 seconds

2. **CNAME Record**:
   - Name: www
   - Value: personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367.replit.app
   - TTL: 300 seconds

## Alternative Setup (if CNAME @ doesn't work):
If your DNS provider doesn't support CNAME for root domain:

1. **CNAME Record**:
   - Name: www
   - Value: personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367.replit.app

2. **URL Redirect/Forwarding**:
   - From: mylinked.app
   - To: https://www.mylinked.app
   - Type: 301 Permanent Redirect

## Step-by-Step Process:

### Step 1: Access Your DNS Settings
1. Log into your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
2. Navigate to DNS Management/DNS Records
3. Find the DNS records for mylinked.app

### Step 2: Delete Wrong Records
1. Delete the A record pointing to 15.197.142.173
2. Remove any other incorrect A records

### Step 3: Add Correct Records
1. Add CNAME record for @ (root) pointing to your Replit app
2. Add CNAME record for www pointing to your Replit app

### Step 4: Save and Wait
1. Save all DNS changes
2. Wait 15-30 minutes for propagation
3. Test both domains

## Expected Results After Fix:
- **mylinked.app**: Should load your MyLinked application
- **www.mylinked.app**: Should load your MyLinked application
- **SSL**: Will be automatically provisioned by Replit

## How to Test:
1. Visit https://mylinked.app
2. Visit https://www.mylinked.app
3. Both should show your MyLinked app

## Troubleshooting:
- If changes don't work immediately, clear browser cache
- Try incognito/private browsing mode
- DNS propagation can take up to 24 hours globally
- Use online DNS checker tools to verify changes
