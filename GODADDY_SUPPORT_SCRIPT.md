### Request to GoDaddy Support
"My domain www.mylinked.app is not working despite correct DNS configuration. The DNS is managed by Cloudflare with correct CNAME record pointing to personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367.replit.app. The application works perfectly on the direct URL, but the custom domain returns 404 errors. Please check if there are any domain-level restrictions, locks, or registry issues preventing proper DNS resolution."

### Alternative Request
If GoDaddy can't help with Cloudflare DNS, ask them to:
1. **Reset DNS to GoDaddy management**
2. **Add CNAME record directly in GoDaddy**
3. **Point www to personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367.replit.app**

## Expected Timeline
- **GoDaddy support response**: 24-48 hours
- **Domain resolution**: Immediate once fixed
- **Alternative**: Switch to different domain registrar

- Application works perfectly on direct URL
- DNS configuration is correct
