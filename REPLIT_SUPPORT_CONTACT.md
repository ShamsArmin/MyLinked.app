## What to Tell Replit Support

**Subject:** Custom Domain SSL Certificate Configuration

**Message:**
```
Hello,

I need help configuring SSL certificate for my custom domain on Replit.

Project Details:
- Project: personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367
- Custom Domain: www.mylinked.app
- Current Status: DNS CNAME working, HTTPS failing

DNS Configuration (Already Working):
- GoDaddy DNS: www.mylinked.app â†’ personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367.replit.app (CNAME)
- HTTP works correctly (redirects to HTTPS)
- HTTPS connection fails

Issue:
The DNS CNAME record is configured correctly and verified by GoDaddy support. However, HTTPS fails because the SSL certificate doesn't cover my custom domain. I need Replit to generate/configure SSL certificate for www.mylinked.app.

Request:
Please enable SSL certificate for www.mylinked.app on my deployment personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367.replit.app.

Thank you!
```

1. Reference the ticket number in future communications
2. Provide any additional information they request
3. Test the domain once they confirm SSL is configured

Your DNS configuration is correct - this is just an SSL certificate coverage issue that Replit support can resolve quickly.
