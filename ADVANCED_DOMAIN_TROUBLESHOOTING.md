# Advanced Domain Troubleshooting - "Not Found" Error

## Current Situation Analysis
- DNS configuration: ✅ Working correctly
- SSL connection: ✅ Established successfully  
- Domain connects: ✅ But returns "Not Found"
- Direct Replit URL: ✅ Works perfectly
- Standard domain setup: ❌ Already attempted, no success

## Deep Technical Analysis

### Issue Type: Server-Side Routing Problem
The "Not Found" response indicates:
1. Your domain connects to a server successfully
2. That server doesn't recognize your domain or doesn't route it correctly
3. The server may be a generic Replit proxy/load balancer
4. Your specific application isn't being routed to

### Potential Root Causes

#### 1. DNS Pointing to Wrong Replit Infrastructure
Your CNAME may be pointing to a generic Replit server instead of your specific deployment.

**Current**: personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367.replit.app
**May need**: A different deployment-specific endpoint

#### 2. Replit Deployment Configuration Issue
- Deployment may not be properly configured for custom domains
- Build/deployment process may have issues
- Application may not be running in production mode

#### 3. Server Configuration Problem
- Application may not be configured to handle custom domain headers
- Reverse proxy configuration may be missing

## Advanced Solutions

### Solution 1: Alternative CNAME Target
Instead of pointing to your development URL, try:
- CNAME: www → [deployment-specific-url].replit.app
- Check your deployment dashboard for exact deployment URL

### Solution 2: Force Deployment Rebuild
1. Delete current deployment completely
2. Rebuild and deploy fresh
3. Then configure custom domains

### Solution 3: Server-Side Domain Handling
Add domain handling to your Express application:

```javascript
// In server/index.ts - add domain handling
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  // Handle custom domain requests
  const host = req.get('host');
  if (host === 'mylinked.app' || host === 'www.mylinked.app') {
    // Ensure proper routing for custom domain
    req.headers['x-forwarded-host'] = host;
  }
  next();
});
```

### Solution 4: Deployment Environment Check
Ensure your deployment is using production configuration:
- Check NODE_ENV=production in deployment
- Verify static files are being served correctly
- Confirm all environment variables are set

### Solution 5: Alternative Domain Strategy
Use a subdomain that works:
- app.mylinked.app instead of www.mylinked.app
- This sometimes bypasses routing issues

## Diagnostic Commands
1. Check exactly which server your domain connects to
2. Verify the deployment URL vs development URL
3. Test with different CNAME targets

## Next Steps Priority
1. Verify deployment is actually in production mode
2. Check if there's a different deployment URL to use
3. Add server-side domain handling code
4. Consider alternative domain approach
