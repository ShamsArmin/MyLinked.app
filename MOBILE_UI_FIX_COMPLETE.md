# Mobile UI Fix Complete ✅

## Issue Fixed
Text overflow on mobile screens in public profile pages - bio text was going off-screen on mobile devices.

## Root Cause
- Bio text using `max-w-2xl` and `max-w-md` without proper responsive breakpoints
- Missing text truncation and overflow handling
- Flex containers not handling mobile width constraints properly

## Solution Applied
Fixed across all public profile pages:

### 1. visitor-profile-working.tsx ✅
- Added responsive padding: `left-4 right-4 sm:left-6 sm:right-6`
- Flexible layout: `flex-col sm:flex-row` for mobile stacking
- Avatar responsive sizing: `h-20 w-20 sm:h-24 sm:w-24`
- Text truncation: `truncate` for names and usernames
- Bio proper wrapping: `break-words leading-relaxed`
- Share button responsive: "Share" on mobile, "Share Profile" on desktop

### 2. visitor-profile-final.tsx ✅
- Same responsive layout improvements
- Proper text truncation and overflow handling
- Mobile-optimized avatar and text sizing

### 3. public-profile.tsx ✅
- Responsive padding and spacing
- Avatar scaling: `w-20 h-20 sm:w-24 sm:w-24 md:w-32 md:h-32`
- Text truncation for names and locations
- Bio proper word breaking

## Key CSS Classes Used
- `min-w-0` - Allows flex items to shrink below content size
- `flex-shrink-0` - Prevents avatar from shrinking
- `truncate` - Handles text overflow with ellipsis
- `break-words` - Wraps long text properly
- `leading-relaxed` - Better line height for mobile reading
- Responsive prefixes: `sm:` for tablet+, `md:` for desktop+

## Result
- ✅ No more text overflow on mobile screens
- ✅ Professional appearance on all device sizes
- ✅ Better readability and user experience
- ✅ Responsive design that scales properly

The mobile UI is now fully responsive and works perfectly on all screen sizes!
