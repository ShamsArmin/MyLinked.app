# Cloudflare DNS Setup - Final Step

## Current Status ✅
- Domain added to Cloudflare: ✅ Active
- Nameservers updated: ✅ Working
- Next step: Configure DNS records

## Configure DNS Records in Cloudflare

### Step 1: Access DNS Settings
1. Click on "mylinked.app" in your Cloudflare dashboard
2. Go to "DNS" tab in the left sidebar
3. You'll see your current DNS records

### Step 2: Delete Existing Records
Delete all existing records for:
- @ (root domain)
- www
- Any A records
- Any old CNAME records

### Step 3: Add New DNS Records

Add these two records exactly:

**Record 1:**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Content: personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367.replit.app
Proxy status: DNS only (gray cloud icon)
TTL: Auto
```

**Record 2:**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: @
Content: www.mylinked.app
Proxy status: DNS only (gray cloud icon)
TTL: Auto
```

### Step 4: Save and Test
1. Save both records
2. Wait 5-10 minutes for propagation
3. Test: https://www.mylinked.app
4. Should now show your MyLinked application

## Important Notes
- Use "DNS only" (gray cloud), NOT "Proxied" (orange cloud)
- Content must be exactly: personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367.replit.app
- No trailing dots or extra characters

## Expected Result
After configuration:
- www.mylinked.app → Your MyLinked app
- mylinked.app → Redirects to www.mylinked.app
- Both domains work with SSL

Your domain is now properly connected to Cloudflare - just need to configure the DNS records to point to your Replit app.
