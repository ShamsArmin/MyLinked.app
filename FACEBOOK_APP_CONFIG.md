# Facebook OAuth - Alternative Solution

## Issue: Facebook Test User Creation Disabled
Facebook has temporarily disabled test user creation, as shown in your screenshot. This is a platform limitation.

## SOLUTION: Make App Live for Public Use

Since test user creation is disabled, we need to make the app live so anyone can use it.

### Step 1: Submit App for Review (Quick Process)
1. Go to: https://developers.facebook.com/apps/1047906810652246/app-review/
2. Click "Request" next to "public_profile" permission
3. Fill out the form:
   - **App Use Case**: "User Authentication"
   - **Detailed Description**: "MyLinked allows users to create professional profiles and link their social media accounts. We use Facebook login to authenticate users and retrieve their basic profile information (name, profile picture) to create their MyLinked account."
   - **Screen Recording**: Not required for public_profile
4. Submit for review

### Step 2: Alternative - Make App Live Without Review
Facebook apps can go live with basic permissions without review:

1. Go to: https://developers.facebook.com/apps/1047906810652246/settings/basic/
2. **App Mode**: Switch from "Development" to "Live"
3. **Data Use Checkup**: Complete if prompted
4. **Terms of Service**: Add if required: `https://db7e7862-12d2-42a3-94ed-8dde37129e5e-00-1t9k44b80d2ae.spock.replit.dev/terms`
5. **Privacy Policy**: Add if required: `https://db7e7862-12d2-42a3-94ed-8dde37129e5e-00-1t9k44b80d2ae.spock.replit.dev/privacy`

### Step 3: Verify Configuration
Ensure these settings are correct:

**Facebook Login Settings:**
- Go to: https://developers.facebook.com/apps/1047906810652246/fb-login/settings/
- **Valid OAuth Redirect URIs**: `https://db7e7862-12d2-42a3-94ed-8dde37129e5e-00-1t9k44b80d2ae.spock.replit.dev/api/auth/facebook/callback`
- **Web OAuth Login**: Enabled

**Basic Settings:**
- **App Domains**: `db7e7862-12d2-42a3-94ed-8dde37129e5e-00-1t9k44b80d2ae.spock.replit.dev`
- **Website URL**: `https://db7e7862-12d2-42a3-94ed-8dde37129e5e-00-1t9k44b80d2ae.spock.replit.dev/`

## Expected Timeline
- **Making app live**: Immediate (if no review required)
- **App review**: 1-3 business days for basic permissions
- **public_profile permission**: Usually auto-approved

## Test After Changes
1. Wait 10-15 minutes for changes to propagate
2. Clear browser cache or use incognito mode
3. Try Facebook login - should work for any Facebook user
4. No more "app isn't available" error

## Why This Works
- Live apps work for all Facebook users
- public_profile is a standard permission usually approved quickly
- Bypasses the test user limitation completely
