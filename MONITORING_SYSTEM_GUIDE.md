# MyLinked Monitoring & Debugging System

## Overview
MyLinked now includes a comprehensive monitoring and debugging system that automatically tracks application health, performance, and errors without requiring manual intervention or live staff.

## Automatic Monitoring Features

### üîç Real-time System Monitoring
- **Memory Usage**: Tracks heap usage and alerts when above 80%
- **Response Times**: Monitors API response times and alerts when above 2 seconds
- **Error Tracking**: Automatically logs all errors and tracks error rates
- **Database Health**: Continuously monitors database connection status
- **Uptime Tracking**: Records system uptime and availability

### üö® Intelligent Alerting
- **High Error Rate**: Alerts when more than 10 errors occur in 5 minutes
- **Memory Pressure**: Alerts when memory usage exceeds 80%
- **Slow Performance**: Alerts when response times exceed 2 seconds
- **Database Issues**: Immediate alerts for database connection problems

### üìä Automatic Data Collection
- **Metrics Collection**: Collects system metrics every minute
- **Error Logging**: Automatically logs all errors with stack traces
- **Performance Tracking**: Tracks API response times and throughput
- **User Activity**: Monitors authentication and user actions

## Monitoring Endpoints

### Admin Monitoring Dashboard
- **`/api/monitoring/status`** - Current system health status
- **`/api/monitoring/metrics`** - Detailed performance metrics
- **`/api/monitoring/logs`** - Recent error logs and system events
- **`/api/monitoring/performance`** - Performance analytics
- **`/api/monitoring/health`** - Public health check endpoint

### System Diagnostics
- **`/api/monitoring/diagnose`** - Complete system diagnostic report
- **`/api/monitoring/alerts`** - Configure alert thresholds

## How It Works

### 1. Request Tracking
Every HTTP request is automatically tracked:
- Response time measurement
- Error detection and logging
- Status code monitoring
- User agent and IP tracking

### 2. System Health Checks
Automated health checks run every minute:
- Memory usage analysis
- Database connectivity tests
- Error rate calculations
- Performance metric collection

### 3. Intelligent Error Handling
When errors occur:
- Automatic logging with full context
- Stack trace preservation
- User and endpoint correlation
- Alert threshold monitoring

### 4. Performance Optimization
Continuous performance monitoring:
- Slow endpoint identification
- Memory leak detection
- Database query optimization alerts
- Response time trending
