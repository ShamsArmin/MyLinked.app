## Additional Records (Recommended)
Also add these TXT records for better email delivery:

### SPF Record
```
Type: TXT
Name: @
Content: v=spf1 include:zoho.com ~all
```

### DMARC Record
```
Type: TXT
Name: _dmarc
Content: v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:your-email@mylinked.app
```

## Verification
After adding MX records:
1. Wait 15-30 minutes for DNS propagation
2. Test email delivery to your @mylinked.app address
3. Check Zoho Mail control panel for domain verification

Your @mylinked.app email should work normally after adding these MX records.
