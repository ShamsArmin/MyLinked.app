# Redirect Loop Fix - DNS Configuration Error

## Current Issue
- Error: "Load cannot follow more than 20 redirects"
- This indicates a redirect loop between your domain and target

## Root Cause
Your DNS records are likely creating a circular reference:
- www.mylinked.app → mylinked.app → www.mylinked.app (infinite loop)

## Solution: Fix DNS Records

### Correct DNS Configuration
You should have these TWO records only:

**Record 1 (Primary):**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Content: personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367.replit.app
Proxy: Proxied (orange cloud)
```

**Record 2 (Root redirect):**
```
Type: A
Name: @
Content: 192.0.2.1 (dummy IP)
Proxy: Proxied (orange cloud)
```

### REMOVE This Incorrect Record
If you have this record, DELETE it:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: @
Content: www.mylinked.app  ← This causes the loop
```

### Alternative Simple Solution
Use only the www subdomain:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Content: personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367.replit.app
Proxy: Proxied (orange cloud)
```

## Steps to Fix
1. Go to Cloudflare → DNS
2. Delete ALL existing records for @ and www
3. Add only the www CNAME record above
4. Test: https://www.mylinked.app
5. Should work without redirect loops

## Why This Happens
- CNAME @ → www.mylinked.app creates a loop
- www → @ → www → @ (infinite redirects)
- Browser stops after 20 redirects with this error

Your domain connection is working, but the DNS configuration needs to be corrected to avoid the redirect loop.
