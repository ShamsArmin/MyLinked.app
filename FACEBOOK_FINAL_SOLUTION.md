# Facebook OAuth Live Mode - Final Solution Attempt

## Root Cause Analysis
Your Facebook app (2696553390542098) is correctly configured but requires Business Verification for unrestricted Live Mode access. This is Facebook's policy for production apps.

## Final Live Mode Fix

### Step 1: Complete Facebook Business Verification (5-10 minutes)
1. Go to Facebook Developer Console → App 2696553390542098
2. Navigate to **App Review → Business Verification**
3. Choose verification method:

**Option A: Business Documents (Fastest)**
- Upload: Business Registration, Tax ID, or Articles of Incorporation
- Or: Bank statement showing business activity

**Option B: Personal Business (Alternative)**
- Upload: Government ID + Utility bill (proof of address)
- Confirm you operate MyLinked as a business

**Option C: Online Verification**
- Link your LinkedIn business profile
- Provide business website (www.mylinked.app)
- Reference business social media accounts

### Step 2: Alternative - Switch to Development Mode (2 minutes)
If business verification isn't possible:
1. **App Settings → Basic → App Mode**: Switch to "Development"
2. **Roles → Developers**: Add your Facebook account
3. Facebook OAuth works immediately for you
4. Public users see professional "use Google login" message

## Technical Implementation Status
✅ Enhanced Live Mode error handling implemented
✅ Professional user guidance to Google OAuth

## Apple OAuth Implementation Ready
If Facebook verification isn't feasible, I can implement Apple OAuth in 15 minutes:

## Recommendation
1. **Try Business Verification** (5-10 minutes) - Best long-term solution
