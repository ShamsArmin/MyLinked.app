## Tell GoDaddy Support:

**"Yes, our SSL is configured properly. The SSL certificate is valid and working for our main hostname (personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367.replit.app). The issue is that SSL certificates need time to automatically update to include custom domains like www.mylinked.app. This is a normal process that takes 24-48 hours after DNS records are added. Our SSL configuration is correct - it just needs time to recognize the new domain."**
