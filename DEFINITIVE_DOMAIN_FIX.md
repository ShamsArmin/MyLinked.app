# DEFINITIVE FIX for www.mylinked.app

## Root Cause Identified
Your domain www.mylinked.app is connecting to IP 34.117.33.233, but this server doesn't have your application. The server returns "Not Found" because it's not configured for your domain.

## The Fix: Change DNS Target

### Current Configuration (NOT WORKING)
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Target: ??? (pointing to wrong server 34.117.33.233)
```

### Correct Configuration (WILL WORK)
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Target: personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367.replit.app
Proxy: DNS only (gray cloud)
```

## Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Update CNAME Record
1. Go to Cloudflare â†’ DNS
2. Find the CNAME record for "www"
3. Edit the Target/Content field
4. Change to: `personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367.replit.app`
5. Ensure proxy is OFF (gray cloud)
6. Save

### Step 2: Verify Configuration
After saving, your record should look like:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Content: personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367.replit.app
Proxy status: DNS only (gray cloud)
```

### Step 3: Test (5 minutes)
```bash
curl -I https://www.mylinked.app
```
Should return: `HTTP/2 200 OK`

## Why This Works
- Your app works perfectly at personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367.replit.app
- DNS directly points to your working app
- No proxy complications
- No SSL certificate issues

## Timeline
- DNS change: Takes effect immediately
- Full propagation: 5-15 minutes
- Your domain will work: Within 15 minutes

## Verification
The fix is successful when:
1. No more "Not Found" errors
2. www.mylinked.app loads your MyLinked application
3. Same functionality as the direct Replit URL

This is the definitive solution - the DNS target is currently incorrect and needs to point to your actual Replit application URL.
