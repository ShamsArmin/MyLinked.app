# Restore Essential DNS Records

## What Happened
You accidentally deleted NS (nameserver) records and MX (email) records along with the A/CNAME records.

## Don't Panic - Easy Fix!

### Step 1: NS Records (Auto-Restored)
- Cloudflare automatically manages NS records
- These should restore themselves within 5-10 minutes
- If not, they'll be:
  - valentin.ns.cloudflare.com
  - donna.ns.cloudflare.com

### Step 2: Add Essential DNS Record
Add this single record to get your domain working:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Content: personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367.replit.app
Proxy: Proxied (orange cloud)
TTL: Auto
```

### Step 3: MX Records (Only if You Need Email)
If you need email for mylinked.app domain, add these later:
```
Type: MX
Name: @
Content: Your email provider's MX record
Priority: 10
```

## Current Priority
1. **Get your website working first** - Add the www CNAME record
2. **Email can wait** - MX records are only for domain email
3. **NS records** - Cloudflare will restore automatically

## Test Your Domain
After adding the www CNAME record:
- Wait 2-3 minutes
- Test: https://www.mylinked.app
- Should work without redirect loops

## What Each Record Does
- **CNAME www**: Makes www.mylinked.app work (ESSENTIAL)
- **NS records**: Tells internet to use Cloudflare (auto-managed)
- **MX records**: For email @mylinked.app (optional for now)

Your domain will work perfectly with just the www CNAME record. Everything else can be added later if needed.
