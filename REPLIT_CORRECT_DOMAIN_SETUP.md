# CORRECT REPLIT DOMAIN SETUP - Official Method

## The Problem with Support's Advice

Replit support told you to use "A record pointing to Replit's IP address" but **Replit doesn't provide static IP addresses**. They use dynamic DNS infrastructure.

## The CORRECT Way (From Replit's Official Documentation)

### Step 1: Go to Your Replit Deployment Settings
1. Open your project: personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367
2. Click the **Deployments** tab
3. Click **Settings** tab
4. Click **Link a domain**

### Step 2: Add Your Domain
1. Enter: `www.mylinked.app`
2. Replit will generate **specific DNS records** for YOUR deployment:
   - **A record** with specific IP address for your deployment
   - **TXT record** for verification

### Step 3: Add Records to GoDaddy
**Remove:** Your current CNAME record
**Add:** The exact A record and TXT record that Replit generated

### Step 4: Wait for Verification
- DNS propagation: Up to 48 hours
- Replit will show "Verified" status when ready
- SSL certificate is automatically provided by Replit

## Why This Works

- Replit generates **deployment-specific** A records
- These are not generic IP addresses
- TXT record is for verification and routing
- SSL certificate is automatically provisioned

## What to Tell Replit Support

"I need the specific A record and TXT record for my deployment personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367. Please provide the exact DNS records from the deployment settings dashboard, not generic IP addresses."

## Important Notes

- Don't use random IP addresses from nslookup
- Don't use static IP addresses (Replit doesn't provide them)
- Use the **exact records** generated in your deployment settings
- Both A record AND TXT record are required

## Alternative: Use Subdomain with CNAME

If you want to avoid A records completely:
1. Use `app.mylinked.app` instead of `www.mylinked.app`
2. Add CNAME: `app.mylinked.app` â†’ `personal-profile-pro-arminshams1367.replit.app`
3. This works immediately without A records

The root cause of your issue is that you need deployment-specific records from Replit's dashboard, not generic IP addresses.
